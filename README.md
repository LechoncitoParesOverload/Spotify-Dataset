-Started assesing the dataset

-While I was analyzing the dataset, I have noticed that there are particular values in some columns that have NaN values (missing values) and decided that instead of deleting their data I set that NaN values to 0

-In the column of streams there is one value in particular that I deducted was an error in the data gathering which is for the streams for the song "Love Grows (Where My Rosemary Goes)" by Edison Lighthouse where the value of streams is just a line with its characteristics instead of the usual integer value and so I changed the value to 0 instead of removing the song and the song's data entirely
